      <p>It’s summertime in the Lakes Region and it’s also Nascar race weekend so some places are considering it a holiday and may have a 2 to 3 night minimum. Airbnb or Homeaway are always good options to find unique places to stay.</p>

      <p>We will provide transportation from the hotels in Wolfeboro to the wedding reception in Laconia and back at the end of the night on Saturday. Please let us know if you're interested in this service.</p>
